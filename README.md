## Requirements

You need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) installed and you'll need
[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) installed and running.

We use [`bcrypt`](https://github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js) for hashing
secrets. If you have issues during installation related to `bcrypt` then [refer
to this wiki
page](https://github.com/jedireza/aqua/wiki/bcrypt-Installation-Trouble).


## Installation

```bash
$ git clone 
$ cd MERN
$ npm install
```


## Configuration

Simply edit `config.js`. The configuration uses
[`confidence`](https://github.com/hapijs/confidence) which makes it easy to
manage configuration settings across environments. __Don't store secrets in
this file or commit them to your repository.__

__Instead, access secrets via environment variables.__ We use
[`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) to help make setting local
environment variables easy (not to be used in production).

Simply copy `.env-sample` to `.env` and edit as needed. 


## First time setup

__WARNING__: This will clear all data in the following MongoDB collections if
they exist: `accounts`, `adminGroups`, `admins`, `authAttempts`, `sessions`,
`statuses`, and `users`.

```bash
$ npm run first-time-setup

# > aqua@0.0.0 first-time-setup /home/jedireza/projects/aqua
# > node first-time-setup.js

# MongoDB URL: (mongodb://localhost:27017/aqua)
# Root user email: jedireza@gmail.com
# Root user password:
# Setup complete.
```


## Running the app

```bash
$ npm start

# > aqua@0.0.0 start /Users/jedireza/projects/aqua
# > gulp react && gulp

# [23:41:44] Using gulpfile ~/projects/aqua/gulpfile.js
# ...
```

Now you should be able to point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and see
the welcome page.

[`nodemon`](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) watches for changes in server code
and restarts the app automatically. [`gulp`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) and
[`webpack`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) watch the front-end files and
re-build those automatically too.

We also pass the `--inspect` flag to Node so you have a debugger available.
Watch the output of `$ npm start` and look for the debugging URL and open it in
Chrome. It looks something like this:

`chrome-devtools://devtools/remote/serve_file/@62cd277117e6f8ec53e31b1be58290a6f7ab42ef/inspector.html?experiments=true&v8only=true&ws=localhost:9229/node`
